 * Minimize steps to reach K from 0 by adding 1 or doubling at each step
Last Updated : 11 Mar, 2024
Given a positive integer K, the task is to find the minimum number of operations of the following two types, required to change 0 to K.

Add one to the operand
Multiply the operand by 2.
Examples:

Input: K = 1
Output: 1
Explanation:
Step 1: 0 + 1 = 1 = K

Input: K = 4
Output: 3
Explanation:
Step 1: 0 + 1 = 1,
Step 2: 1 * 2 = 2,
Step 3: 2 * 2 = 4 = K

Approach:

Uses dynamic programming to solve this problem. In this case, the subproblems are the minimum number of operations required to reach each number from 1 to k.

Initializes an array dp[] of size k+1 to store the minimum number of operations required to reach each number from 1 to k. Iterates through the numbers from 1 to k, and for each number i, it considers two options:

Adding 1 to the previous number i-1. This is represented by dp[i] = dp[i-1] + 1.
Doubling the previous even number i/2. This is represented by dp[i] = min(dp[i], dp[i/2] + 1).
The first option is straightforward. To reach number i, you can simply add 1 to the previous number i-1. The second option, if i is even, you can reach it by doubling the previous even number i/2. This is because doubling an even number always results in an even number.

By considering both options for each number, weâ€™ll ensures that it finds the minimum number of operations required to reach k. The final result is stored in dp[k], which represents the minimum number of operations needed to reach k from 1. */



#include <stdio.h>

int min (int a, int b) {
    return ((a < b) ? a : b);
}
int minSteps(int k) {
    int dp[k+1];
    memset(dp, 0, sizeof(dp));
    for (int i = 1; i <= k; i++) {
        dp[i] = dp[i-1] + 1;
        if (i % 2 == 0) {
            dp[i] = min(dp[i], dp[i/2]+1);
        }
    }
    return dp[k];
}
int main() {
        int k = 2;
        int min = minSteps(k);
        printf("Min steps : %d\n", min);

    return 0;
}
